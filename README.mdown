===========

This repo contains R functions to estimate error rates; to generate the a list of white loci and population maps to run the *populations* program of *Stacks*; to perform a PCoA; and, to estimate the distance between individuals of the same population. The scripts assume than several datasets will be compared (e.g. the several outputs of assembling the data with different parameters). 

#### Error rates

The R functions to estimate the loci, allele and SNP error rates are:

+ [LociAllele_error.R](./LociAllele_error.R), which uses a tsv matrix of alleles and loci (formated as the output of *export_sql* from  *Stacks* but keeping only the columns CatalogID  Consensus	SNPs Sample1 Sample1_r Sample2 ...) to convert it to genlight object to estimate loci and allele error rates between replicate pairs. The function produces a dataframe with the following columns for each replicate pair:

 + "nloci" = total number of loci in the dataset 
 + "nMissLoc" = number of missing loci for both samples of a replicate pair 
 + "MissTotProp", = nMissLoc/nloci
 + "shareMissLoc" = number of loci that are lost in both samples of  replicate pair
 + "loci.mismatches" = number of loci that failed in the sample or replicate, but not in both
 + "unshareMissLoc" = loci.mismatches/nMissLoc
 + "loci.error.rate" =  loci.mismatches/nloci
 + "n.loci.woNA" = number of loci that were NOT missing in both samples or a replicate pair
 + "allele.mismatches" = number of alleles that mismatch between samples of a replicate pair 
 + "allele.error.rate" allele.mismatches/n.loci.woNA

and 

+ [SNPs_error.R](./SNPs_error.R) that uses a genlight object of SNPs, (obtained by e.g. transforming a plink.raw to genlight object) to estimate SNP error rates.


The function [PairsDiff.R](./PairsDiff.R) wraps up `LociAllele_error.R` and `SNPs_error.R` to estimate loci, allele and SNP error rates and visualize the Matrix of SNPs as a plot.


#### White lists and Population Map

+ [whitePopMap.R](./whitePopMap.R) creates a list of the samples present in a desired df (e.g. a subsection or of the tsv output of *explort_sql*) and writes a file that can be read by *Stacks* as a Population Map of desired samples to analyse with the *populations* program

+ [whiteRADlist.R](./whiteRADlist.R) creates a list of the CatalogID loci present in a desired matrix and write a file that can be read by Stacks as whitelist of desired loci to perform analyses with the *populations* program.


#### Compare distance between populations and PCoA

+ [dist.pop.R](./dist.pop.R) estimate distance between individuals of the same population
+ [PCoA_pop.r](./PCoA_pop.r) performs a PCoA.
